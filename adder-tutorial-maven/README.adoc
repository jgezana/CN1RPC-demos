= Simple Adder Tutorial (Maven)

This is a sample project using the https://github.com/shannah/CN1RPC[CN1RPC library] to implement a simple client-server application in Codename One.  It uses Codename One for the client and a Maven Java Web Project for the server - and CN1RPC for client server communication.

See the https://github.com/shannah/CN1RPC/wiki/SimpleAdder-Tutorial[companion tutorial] for more information.

Also check out the link:../adder-tutorial[non-maven version of this project] to see how to use a regular Java Web Project for the server project.

== Build Instructions

**Get a list of available build targets:**

----
$ ant -p
----

**Run Project**

----
$ ant
----

**Clean project**

----
$ ant clean-all
----

NOTE: Don't be fooled by the use of Ant here.  The server project is still using Maven. I just use Ant to provide an adhoc build for the project as a whole.  It calls maven to do the server project build.
